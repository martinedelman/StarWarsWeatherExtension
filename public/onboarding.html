		<h1>Thank You for Installing Star Wars Weather</h1>
		<p>I hope you will enjoy using this extension, if you do, please consider sharing it with friends or family.</p>
		<p>Please make sure you have location services turned on so that this extension can work properly. Instructions are below.</p>
		<p>If you have any issues, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/star-wars-weather/hjphhbgleggdljkdlmlblbamlnkmdgag?hl=en&authuser=0">contact me</a> via the "support tab".</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>How do I change the temperature unit / language? </h3>
		<p>To access all available settings, click on the puzzle piece icon located in the top right corner of your
			Chrome/Firefox browser and choose "Star Wars Weather" from the options. This will open a dropdown menu from which
			you can make your desired changes.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>How often does the extension update the weather information?</h3>
		<p>The extension will get the most accurate weather information when you open a new tab. It will keep that
			information stored until the end of the hour. For example, if you open a new tab at 8:37, the extension will keep
			the weather information stored until 9:00. This is done to make sure the information is accurate and to reduce the
			time it takes to load the information again.</p>
